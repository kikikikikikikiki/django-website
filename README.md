# Django website
A Django website project<br/>
The most interesting part is probably : 
 reimagined-octo-telegram/mysitegit/main/which.py
<br/>  
Which is a logic calculator I used to design the interface for the gallery page
<br/>  
reimagined-octo-telegram/mysitegit/main/views.py
<br/>
Basically, for each button that is clicked, four images derived from the respective image appear<br/>
<br/>
Each image is based on a position on a circle (or sin wave)<br/>
<br/>
Each image can be altered in two dimensions based on a rotation around a circle (or phase in a sin wave)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The upper right link increases both dimensions by 1/2 pi radians<br/>
<br/>
The top left increase one dimension by 1/2 pi and decrease the other dimension by 1/2 pi<br/><br/>
The bottom right does the opposite of top left<br/><br/>
The bottom left decreases both dimensions by 1/2 pi radians<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably completely pointless, but it was fun to make :D
